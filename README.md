# This is an example document for the MAD Lab 8 Group Work Project

## Group Members:
- Anu Bharadwaj
- Caren Chang
- Dan Ndombe
- Marina Tanasyuk

## App Ideas:
- app that lets postal workers efficiently plan out their mail delivery route for the day to help save time and resources
- app to help students create and review flashcards
- App that presents to you a randomized recipe to cook for the day
- Bonus: you can share pictures of what you make with your friends
- App that helps seniors find community events to attend

## Final App Idea:
**Memento : A Flashcard app** 

The average student spends 40+% of their time studying for classes. To help students study in a more efficient manner, the Memento app will allow them to easily create and review digital flashcards. Students can easily track flashcards that need more reviewing and set reminders to help them develop a consistent study schedule.

## User Stories:

## Must have 
- User should be able to create a new flashcard by inputting a question and answer in text form
- Bonus: User can use images as the question / answer
- User should be able to tap on a question and see the answer revealed
- User should be able to browse all the flashcards they created 
- User should be able to delete flashcards

## Maybe
- User should be able to edit the content of flashcards
- User should be able to create separate ‘decks’ of flashcards that can be reviewed individually
- User can chose create flashcards with multiple choice answers
- User can chose to review flashcards in a ‘quiz’ mode, where a score is kept as users review a deck of cards and choice answers through multiple choices

## Would be nice to have
- User should be able to share decks of cards with other users of the app
